cdrdao (1:1.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Do not build the gcdmaster binary package anymore because it depends on the
    obsolete libgnomeuimm library which is going to be removed from Debian.
    (Closes: #707861)
  * debian/control:
    - Drop libgnomeuimm-2.6-dev and libgtkmm-2.4-dev from Build-Depends, they
      are going to be removed from Debian.
    - Add libgconf2-dev and dh-autoreconf to Build-Depends and remove
      autotools-dev.
    - Make libperl4-corelibs-perl | perl (<< 5.12.3-7) a recommendation instead
      of a full dependency. This is acceptable because the example perl scripts
      are not required by cdrdao to function properly. (Closes: #699320)
  * Override lintian warning script-uses-perl4-libs-without-dep.
  * debian/rules:
    - Build with --autoreconf instead with --autotools_dev to recreate the
      whole build system during build time.
    - Disable lame, scglib and xdao support explicitly.
    - Override dh_auto_install and change the destination directory to
      debian/tmp thus no further changes are required for the existing install
      files.

    flags.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4, no changes required.
  * cdrdao-binary: Add missing dependency on
    libperl4-corelibs-perl | perl (<< 5.12.3-7). (Closes: #658944)
  * Update debian/copyright to copyright format 1.0.
  * Add missing dep3 header to 15-kfreebsd-gnu.patch.
  * debian/patches:
    - Add 18-create-valid-desktop-file.patch and remove deprecated UTF-8
      Encoding entry, fix outdated categories and Icon entry.
    - Add 19-fix-format-not-a-string-literal-error.patch which prevents a FTBFS.
    - Add 20-fix-spelling-and-hypen-used-as-minus.patch which corrects errors of
      the same name in cdrdao's and gcdmaster's manpage.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use dh sequencer to simplify debian/rules and to provide recommended
      build-arch and build-indep targets.
    - Build with --parallel.
    - Use --with autotools_dev addon to provide an up-to-date config.sub and
      config.guess file and do not remove these files in the clean target.
    - Build with --Wl, --as-needed to avoid unnecessary dependencies on
      gcdmaster.
    - Enable all hardening build flags with hardening=+all.
  * Add watch file. Thanks to Bart Martens.

  * Fix manpage to include current authors (closes: #300958)

      there is a '#include <gtk--.h>' listed before it.
      [xcdrdao.cc gcdmaster.cc ViewSwitcher.cc RecordTocSource.cc
      RecordHDTarget.cc DeviceList.cc CdDevice.cc] I have no idea what I am

  * Use config.sub and config.guess from autotools-dev (add build-dependeny)
  * remove and generate symlinks in RULES for ia64 parisc(64) and s390
    The last NMU copied the files for s390 instead, making the patch grow.
